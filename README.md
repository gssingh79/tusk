#### What is Air Quality Index (AQI) ?
The AQI is an index for reporting daily air quality. It tells you how clean or polluted your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for you. The AQI measures five criteria air pollutants (particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone), and converts the measured pollutant concentrations in a community's air to a number on a scale of 0 to 500.

#### Air Quality Index (AQI) Values	Levels of Health Concern	Colors <br>

| When the AQI is in this range:  |	Air quality conditions are:    |	As symbolized by this color:    | Heath concerns are: |
|:------------------------------|:-------------------------------|:--------------------------------|:------------------|
|0 to 50                       |	Good                          | Green       | poses little or no risk |
|51 to 100	| Moderate | Yellow | for some pollutants there may be a moderate health concern |
|101 to 150	| Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups |	Orange | Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects |
|151 to 200 |	Unhealthy |	Red | overall experience health effects; sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects |
|201 to 300 |	Very Unhealthy |	Purple | everyone may experience more serious health effects |
|301 to 500 |	Hazardous |	Maroon | Health warnings of emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected |

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data showed the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi at 412, which falls in the 'severe category', while the Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting (SAFAR) recorded an AQI of 388, which comes under the 'very poor' category. <br>

This video illustrates the ups and downs of air quality index on different coordinates of New Delhi (capital of India). AQI is not constant over period of months but shows quite interesting variations with onsets of different festivals /seasons and community occasions in the city. Also visualization is differentiated for residential and industrial areas in orange and blue respectively
...So when will you go out to camp..? :D if ever..


### How I did it?

1. Data points were extracted from official CPCD site: http://cpcb.nic.in/ambient-aq-data-delhi-ncr/
2. Data is cleaned like date from different locations were different therefore was formatted in to same format 
3. Feature generation: Total AQI was calculated from Individual AQI list of all pollutants.
4. Excel calculator for reference:  https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr_docs/AQI%20-Calculator.xls
5. Video was created using Map feature in MS-Excel by adding up layers and selecting AQI as height of bars

### Insights:
1. From Data collected, Delhi's air quality has oscillated between the 'very poor' and the 'severe' categories whole year with slight lowest and in safe range in mid-year (month of August) which is also time of year with less leat festivals. 
2. As Diwali and New year approaches -- in last quarter of year, AQI again takes a hike. 
3. Whole video shows AQI of both residential and industrial areas, with residential AQI overall less than industrial counterparts at any given time ogf year.
