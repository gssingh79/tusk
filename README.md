...So when will you go out to camp..? :D if ever..


### How I did it?

1. Data points were extracted from official CPCD site: http://cpcb.nic.in/ambient-aq-data-delhi-ncr/
2. Data is cleaned like date from different locations were different therefore was formatted in to same format 
3. Feature generation: Total AQI was calculated from Individual AQI list of all pollutants.
4. Excel calculator for reference: http://cpcb.nic.in/ambient-aq-data-delhi-ncr/
5. Video was created using Map feature in MS-Excel by adding up layers and selecting AQI as height of bars
